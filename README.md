# 🌾 Crop Sharing Platform

The **Crop Sharing Platform** is a full-stack web application designed to bridge the gap between **farmers** and **buyers** by providing a transparent, secure, and efficient digital marketplace for agricultural produce.  

Farmers can upload crop details, manage incoming buyer requests, and make informed decisions by accepting or rejecting offers. Buyers can explore available crops, place price requests, and track the status of their requests in real time.  

The platform ensures **direct communication**, **fair pricing**, and **role-based access**, reducing dependency on middlemen and enabling better decision-making for both parties.
